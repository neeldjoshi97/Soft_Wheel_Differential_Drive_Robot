# Soft-Wheeled Differential Drive Robot

This repository provides a brief overview of the team research project for [24-673 Soft Robots: Mechanics, Design, and Modeling](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/education/courses/24-673.html) course taught by [Prof. Carmel Majidi](https://www.meche.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/majidi-carmel.html) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu) (CMU).

## Overview

In this research project, our team developed an inflatable/deflatable soft wheel system designed for wheeled robotic platforms. The key idea lies in dynamically controlling the inflation levels of the wheels on either side of the robot, thereby altering their effective radii. This differential in wheel size induces a natural curvature in the robot’s trajectory, enabling smooth and intuitive directional control $-$  without relying on traditional steering mechanisms (which do not work so well with softer materials).

By modulating air pressure within the wheels, our robot can seamlessly turn left or right, offering a lightweight, adaptable, and mechanically simplified solution for locomotion in soft robotics.

## Acknowledgement

My friend and teammate in this project, Sidhant Gupta originally came up with this 'differential-drive-in-soft-robots' idea.

## Motivation [[1]](#references)

Deploying soft-wheeled robots on ground has always been a challenge. The work by Almusa et al. [[1]](#references) was used as foundation to progress the concept of soft wheels in mobile robots. They combined soft silicone-based materials with rigid components (grousers) to balance strong traction from the hard structure with the shock-absorbing qualities of the soft material.

We took a step by further by reducing rigit structures exposed to the terrain as described in following sections.

## Making

For building components for the soft wheel, we utilised the CMU makerspace called [TechSpark](https://engineering.cmu.edu/techspark/) in the College of Engineering. For details on assembly and individual components, refer [publication](#publication).

## Physical Evaluation

I was in-charge of making plans for testing the soft wheel for:
- Study traction on different types of surfaces with varying inflation of the wheel
- Characterise slipping on different types of surfaces with varying inflation of the wheel

We were able to get our hands on the carousel-like testing-bed at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/), the same that was used by the authors of this [paper](#references). After re-connecting some wires and playing around with the controls using an Arduino board, we were able to get it working.

The rig was originally designed to test wheel performance on sand, which served as the default surface in all experiments.

- The traction was characterised from the imprints created by the wheel in the sand.
- The slipping study used data from wheel encoders which we had connected to the Arduino.
